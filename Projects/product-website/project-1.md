# Project Description

In this project, we'll build a product website with extensive routing functionalities. We'll use the Fake Store API to fetch and display product categories and the products in the store.

To achieve this, we'll utilize the React Router library, which offers a diverse range of routing functionalities. We will employ nested and dynamic routing concepts to showcase the products within a particular category and provide a comprehensive view of individual product details.

The application's components are styled to provide you with an initial template of the application. We can style and customize them as we want.

### Task-0 : Initial Setup

In this project, you’ll create a product website to fetch some items from the Fake Store API and use different types of routing functionalities using the React Router library.

To start with this project, a template has been added to the /usercode/products/ directory. This template has been created using the create-react-app products command. The template includes some other starter files for this project.

The following gives a brief overview of the files and folders present in the /usercode/products/ directory:

The /usercode/products/src/App.js file contains the App component, which loads all the additional components that need to be rendered on the page.

The /usercode/products/src/App.css file contains the styles for the application.

The /usercode/products/src/images/ directory contains the assets that are used in this project.

The /usercode/products/src/components/ directory contains different components of the application.

Before starting work on the application, let’s verify if the initial React project that has been provided is working fine. To do so, switch to the “App Browser” tab and click the “Refresh” icon to see the application.
